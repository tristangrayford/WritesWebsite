        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Tristan Gray was a latecomer to Scotland, moving to the north from
          Jersey in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years of searching to find the real spark behind his writing
          Scotland unlocked it - The rugged country and dark history, which also
          inspired the works of George R. Martin, David Gemmell, and the
          thriving local Science Fiction and Fantasy scene, gave new meaning to
          the fantasy tales of his childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, with a new connection to an adopted home driving his work, and
          inspiration stretching from conventional novels, to graphic novels, to
          games, Tristan is writing tales worthy of the inspiration by the land
          around him.
        </p>

          2024. The local writing community page can be found at{" "}
